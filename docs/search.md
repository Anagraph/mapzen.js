# Add Mapzen Search box to a map

mapzen.js includes options for adding a Mapzen Search geocoder box to a map. To use this part of mapzen.js, you need to sign up for a [Mapzen Search API key](https://mapzen.com/developers).

```javascript
var geocoder = L.Mapzen.geocoder('mapzen-api-key');
geocoder.addTo(map);
```

In this code, you are passing one parameter to the search, which is the API key inside the single quotes. The API key is a code that uniquely identifies your developer account without providing a password. Sign up for your own API key at https://mapzen.com/developers.

With a key, you have the full [Mapzen Search rate limits](https://mapzen.com/documentation/overview/#rate-limits) available to you. If you do not provide a valid API key, the number of queries you can perform are reduced greatly.

### Options

#### Control the search query behavior

These options affect the behavior of Mapzen Search itself.

| Option  | Type   | Default | Description                      |
|---------|--------|---------|----------------------------------|
`url` | String | `https://search.mapzen.com/v1` | Host endpoint for a Pelias-compatible search API.
`bounds` | [Leaflet LatLngBounds object](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlngbounds) or Boolean | `false` | If `true`, search is bounded by the current map view. You may also provide a custom bounding box in form of a LatLngBounds object. _Note: `bounds` is not supported by autocomplete._
`focus` | [Leaflet LatLng object](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlng) or Boolean | `true` | If `true`, search and autocomplete prioritizes results near the center of the current view. You may also provide a custom LatLng value (in any of the [accepted Leaflet formats](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#latlng)) to act as the center bias.
`layers` | String or Array | `null` | Filters results by layers ([documentation](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/search/#filter-by-data-type)). If left blank, results will come from all available layers.
`params` | Object | `null` | An object of key-value pairs which will be serialized into query parameters that will be passed to the Mapzen Search API. This allows custom queries that are not already supported by the convenience options listed above. Note that in case of conflicting parameters, this option takes precedence. All supplied parameters are passed through; this library doesn't know which are valid parameters and which are not.

#### Set the search appearance and interaction behavior

These options affect the appearance and interaction behavior of the geocoder.

| Option  | Type   | Default | Description                      |
|---------|--------|---------|----------------------------------|
`autocomplete` | Boolean | `true` | If `true`, suggested results are fetched on each keystroke. If `false`, this is disabled and users must obtain results by pressing the Enter key after typing in their query.
`collapsible` | boolean | `true`  | Search component automatically adjusting collapsing behavior. |
`expanded` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, the search input is always expanded. It does not collapse into a button-only state.
`position` | String | `'topleft'` | Corner in which to place the geocoder control. Values correspond to Leaflet [control positions](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-positions).
`placeholder` | String | `'Search'` | Placeholder text to display in the search input box. Set to blank or `null` to disable.
`title` | String | `'Search'` | ToolTip text to display on the search button when collapsed. Set to blank or `null` to disable.
`panToPoint` | Boolean | `true` | If `true`, highlighting a search result pans the map to that location.
`pointIcon` | Boolean or String | `true` | If `true`, an icon is used to indicate a point result, matching the `venue` or `address` [layer types]((https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/search/#filter-by-data-type)). If `false`, no icon is displayed. For custom icons, pass a string containing a path to the image.
`polygonIcon` | Boolean or String | `true` | If `true`, an icon is used to indicate a polygonal result, matching any [layer type](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/search/#filter-by-data-type) that is not an address or venue. If `false`, no icon is displayed. For custom icons, pass a string containing a path to the image.
`markers` | [Leaflet Marker options object](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#marker-options) or Boolean | `true` | If `true`, search results drops Leaflet's default blue markers onto the map. You may customize this marker's appearance and behavior using Leaflet [marker options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#marker-options).
`fullWidth` | Integer or Boolean | `650` | If `true`, the input box will expand to take up the full width of the map container. If an integer breakpoint is provided, the full width applies only if the map container width is below this breakpoint.
`place` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, selected results will make a request to the service [`/place` endpoint](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/place/). If `false`, this is disabled. The geocoder does not handle responses to `/place`; you will need to do handle it yourself in the `results` event listener.


### Methods

If you want to implement your own search UI, or want to use search result without built-in UI component, you can use these methods.

| Option  | Return | Description                      |
|---------|---------|----------------------------------|
`getSearchResult (<String>input, <function> callback)` | null | executes `callback(err, result)` with the search result from `input`. `result` is in [GeoJson format](https://search.mapzen.com/v1/search?text=yMcA). |
`getAutocompleteResult(<String>input, <function> callback)` | null |  executes `callback(err, result)` with the autocomplete result from `input`.  `result` is in [GeoJson format](https://search.mapzen.com/v1/autocomplete?text=yMcA)|
