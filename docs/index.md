MapzenJS
====

Mapzen.js is an open-source web API and an extension of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). This API offers the full extent of the Leaflet library with additional functions to make using Mapzen tools as simple as possible. With Mapzen.js you can add [Mapzen House Styles]() as a basemap, build a customizable geocoder with [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/products/search/), and can create fragment URLs to be able to share the exact map instance with someone.
